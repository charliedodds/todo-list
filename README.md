# Todo List Project

### Styling

This project's style was inspired by real productivity app [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). I love how the app is simple and minimalist but still looks cool.

## Projects

Projects are made up of smaller tasks, with a communal end-goal.

This could be something as small and as simple as making dinner.

## Todos

Add a todo to a project which will help you achieve your project goal.

Using the dinner example, these could be prepping food, putting it in the oven etc.

## Live Demo

You can create your own todo list [here](https://charliedodds.github.io/todo-list/).
